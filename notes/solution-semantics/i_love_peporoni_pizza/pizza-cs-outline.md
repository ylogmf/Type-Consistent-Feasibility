# pizza — Physics / Philosophy Wrapper

## Positioning

This document outlines a physics- and philosophy-oriented extension of **pizza**.

It does **not** propose new physical theories, laws, or predictions.
It relies entirely on the framework established in *pizza* and explores
its implications for physical interpretation and explanation.

Non-claims:
- No new physical laws are proposed.
- No existing equations are modified.
- No experimental predictions are made.
- No ontological claims are asserted as facts.

---

## 0. Abstract

- This note applies the *pizza* framework to physical interpretation.
- It examines why physical explanation is structurally constrained by observation.
- The focus is on interpretive limits, not physical models.

---

## 1. Introduction

- Persistent interpretive disputes in physics.
- Multiple empirically equivalent explanations.
- The difficulty of deciding “what is really happening.”

---

## 2. The pizza Framework (Foundational Reference)

- Summary of *pizza*’s core commitments:
  - Internal derivation defines fact.
  - Observation provides verification, not proof.
  - External interfaces are non-invertible.
- This wrapper does not alter these commitments.

---

## 3. Observation and the Observer

- Observer treated as an instantiation of an interface.
- De-personalized, non-epistemic treatment.
- Observer parameters vs internal structure.

---

## 4. Observation Is Not Fact

- Existential support vs universal proof.
- Finite observation cannot establish facts.
- This is a methodological boundary, not a physical claim.

---

## 5. Time as an Interface-Dependent Concept

- Time as experienced through observation.
- Distinction between internal generation and observed ordering.
- No ontological claims about time itself.

---

## 6. Light and Measurement

- Light as a medium of observation.
- Measurement as an irreversible interface process.
- Seeing vs knowing.

---

## 7. Gravity as an Interpretive Constraint

- Gravity discussed as an interface-level constraint.
- No claims about physical origin or mechanism.
- Purely interpretive positioning.

---

## 8. Extreme Regimes (Optional)

- Black holes and extreme observational conditions.
- Thought experiments about interface compression.
- Explicitly speculative and interpretive.

---

## 9. Implications for Physical Explanation

- Why interpretive plurality is unavoidable.
- Why ultimate explanation is structurally undecidable.
- Explanation limits as a feature, not a failure.

---

## 10. Conclusion

- Summary of interpretive consequences.
- Reinforcement of the boundary defined by *pizza*.
- Emphasis on what can and cannot be legitimately claimed.
